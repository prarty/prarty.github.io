                            "I've seen a huge amount of progress in Pratibha's technical ability and confidence. She is highly competent, producing really high quality code with excellent creative problem solving skills."

                            "When Pratibha started in the team, she was fairly quiet, with Prasanth, our Tech Lead at the time, taking the lead and speaking for the team as such. Whilst Pratibha's technical skills were never questioned, and Prasanth always spoke very highly of Pratibha, I personally did not see as much of Pratibha's direct output. 

                            Since then, I've seen a huge amount of progress in Pratibha's technical ability and confidence, which ramped up even more significantly when Prasanth left as Pratibha very much took the lead in the WebPIM space and really made that role her own, whilst visibly shaping the direction of the Product Data Service.

                            Our new Tech Lead, Temi, has fed back that Pratibha is highly competent from a technical development perspective, producing really high quality code. She has excellent creative problem solving skills, thinking outside the box and always taking into account the bigger picture, is wonderful to work with and incredibly collaborative. She has also been very supportive of more junior members of the team, and very happily mentoring one of our developers, Colin.

                            Pratibha's communication is very good, with very clear and precise updates. She's built a great relationship with the whole team, but particularly with our QA Team, where her input has been superb. Pratibha is always looking to improve quality or code, process or design, and as a result, we've made great headway in these areas. 

                            I wanted to particularly call out Pratibha's efforts over our last migration weekend, which required a lot to happen in a short space of time. Not only did he very willingly give up her weekend, but following numerous issues outside of our control, worked very long hours to ensure we hit our deadlines. She completely took control of certain aspects of the migration, driving through key changes that simply could not have happened without her hard work and technical capabilities. 

                            I love working with Pratibha, as do the rest of the team. She's a pleasure to have around and a real asset to John Lewis."

This involved handling complex workflows such as secure file exchange, metadata handling, and API-driven automation—all of which required deep technical understanding and close collaboration with both internal teams and the client.

                            She demonstrated exceptional ownership and problem-solving throughout the project, proactively resolving blockers and ensuring a smooth delivery. Her leadership, attention to detail, and commitment to quality played a pivotal role in making the Box integration a major success.
